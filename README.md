# WAMPH
An abstract schema for dealing with message data.

So... how to explain this. **Data.** We use it all the time, but we don't always have a consistant way of representing it. ([Though](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) [that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) is [not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers) [for](https://github.com/vstakhov/libucl) [lack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One) [of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) [trying](https://xkcd.com/927/).) WAMPH attempts to address this by coming up with some *conventions* for how to name / organize data, and provides a syntax for describing data *without* dictating how data is physically represented.

## Choice of name
Originally WAMF stood for Will's Abstract Message Format. However, WAMF had some unpleasant definitions on Urban Dictionary so I changed it to WAMPH. It should be pronounced the same, but now has no assigned meaning.
